/**
 * GlueStick uses webpack-isomorphic-tools to support server side rendering.
 * The syntax for this is slightly different than the webpack config file.
 * Instead of defining a `test` regex, you supply an array of extensions.
 * For more information see: https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools
 *
 * Example:
 * additionalLoaders: [
 *   {
 *     extensions: ["xml"],
 *     loader: "xml-loader"
 *   }
 * ]
 *
 * For the previous example to work, you would need to install `xml-loader` via npm. Then
 * you can use this loader by simply using the `import` syntax like:
 * import myData from "assets/xml/my-file.xml";
 *
 * Loaders also support `include`, `exclude` and `query`.
 * Additionally, you can provide a `test` regex instead of `extensions`
 * in order to bypass webpack-isomorphic-tools when needed.
 *
 *
 * When adding additionalAliases, follow this pattern:
 * additionalAliases: {
 *   "aliasName": ["path", "to", "location"]
 * }
 *
 * for example:
 * additionalAliases: {
 *   "lib" : ["src", "lib"],
 *   "selectors" : ["src", "selectors"]
 * }
 *
