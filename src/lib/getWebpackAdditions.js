/**
 * GlueStick uses webpack-isomorphic-tools to support server side rendering.
 * The syntax for this is slightly different than the webpack config file.
 * Instead of defining a `test` regex, you supply an array of extensions.
 * For more information see: https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools.
 *
 * In order for the webpack-isomorphic-tools format to work with our webpack config, we
 * need to convert the `extensions` array to a regex.
 *
 * @param {Array<Object>} additions array of loaders or preloaders formatted for webpack-isomorphic-tools
 * @param {Array<String>} additions[n].extensions array of strings representing file extensions
 * @param {String} additions[n].loader name of the loader to use
 * @param {RegExp} additions[n].test - test regex for webpack
 *
 * @return {Object}
