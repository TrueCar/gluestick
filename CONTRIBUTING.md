Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `next`.
2. **Describe your test plan in your commit.** If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation (`docs` folder).
4. Ensure tests, lints and flow-check pass on *Circle CI*.

## Style Guide

### Code

#### General

* **Most important: Look around.** Match the style you see used in the rest of the project. This includes formatting, naming things in code, naming things in documentation.
* Add trailing commas,
* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)

#### JavaScript

* We are using extended `eslint-config-airbnb` - make sure your code doesn't result in any lint errors.
* We are also using [FlowType](https://flowtype.org/) for static type checking - make sure your code doesn't produce any flow errors.
* No `Object`, `Function` and `any | *` types are allowed (except for edge cases) - make sure all types have detailed description.
* When writing CLI we use `CommonJS` to handle import/export - please do not mix them with ES6 imports. The only exception are Flow types where we use ES6 imports.

### Documentation

* Do not wrap lines at 80 characters - configure your editor to soft-wrap when editing documentation.

## Issues

We are using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

# Git flow

`next` -> `staging` -> `master`

* All new features, enhancements and contributions go to `next`
* We cut release candidates using git tags from `staging`
  * QA and testing are done on `staging`  
  * High priority bugs are worked on `staging`. Once the PR is reviewed and merged, then we open another PR that `cherry-pick` those changes into `next`
* When `staging` is ready for a final release, we merge it into `master` which is our official production branch
